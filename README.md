# Visionary
A lightweight surveillance script that monitors specific activities. First available in powershell, later perhaps on bash as well.

## Description
Visionary is designed to provide a simple yet effective way to monitor and log specific activities in your environment. Whether you need to keep an eye on file changes, user actions, or other critical events, Visionary offers a streamlined solution to help you stay informed.
The main thought behind Visionary is to set a Folder which will be under surveillance from any changes or events, witness the unseen.

Small note, the way the logo gets displayed is worth to look at...

ðŸš§ Under major construction!!! ðŸš§

## Monitoring services duplicate for each path given!! Watchers cease to exist once the session in powershell is closed!
